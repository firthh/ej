# ej

A command line tool to quickly turn `edn` to `json`. 

## Usage

By default it streams from stdin and prints json to stdout.
An example of how you might use it in that way:
```bash
./o.sh | ej | jq
```

Optionally you can use it to parse a file:
```
ej -f testfile.edn
```

For debugging you can output the elapsed time to parse out output the JSON:
```
ej -ft testfile.edn
```

## Building

### Requirements
 - leiningen
 - java?
